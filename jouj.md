# REST API Workshop: NestJS, Prisma, PostgreSQL, and Swagger

## Introduction
In this workshop, we will learn how to build a backend REST API for a blog application called "Median", using NestJS, Prisma, PostgreSQL, and Swagger. This tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly but assumes some basic knowledge of JavaScript/TypeScript and NestJS【9†source】.

## Technologies Used
- NestJS as the backend framework
- Prisma as the Object-Relational Mapper (ORM)
- PostgreSQL as the database
- Swagger for API documentation
- TypeScript as the programming language【8†source】

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript or TypeScript
- Basic knowledge of NestJS
- Node.js installed
- Docker or PostgreSQL installed
- Prisma VSCode Extension (optional)
- Access to a Unix shell (optional)【9†source】【10†source】

## Workshop Steps

### 1. Generate the NestJS Project
- Install and utilize the NestJS CLI to create a new project named 'median'【11†source】.

### 2. Create a PostgreSQL Instance
- Set up PostgreSQL on your machine, optionally using Docker【12†source】.

### 3. Set Up Prisma
- Install the Prisma CLI and initialize Prisma in your project【13†source】.
- Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in your `.env` file【14†source】.

### 4. Model the Data
- Create an `Article` model in your Prisma schema to represent each blog article【15†source】.

### 5. Migrate the Database
- Run migrations to create the tables in your database using Prisma【16†source】.

### 6. Seed the Database
- Populate your database with initial data using a Prisma seed script【17†source】.

### 7. Create a Prisma Service
- Abstract away the Prisma Client API by creating a `PrismaService` in your NestJS application【18†source】.

### 8. Set Up Swagger
- Install necessary dependencies and set up Swagger for API documentation【19†source】.

### 9. Implement CRUD Operations for Article Model
- Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for the `Article` model【20†source】.

## Conclusion
This workshop will guide you through building a REST API with modern tools, enhancing your understanding of backend development. Let's get started!
